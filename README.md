# micro-bit
Small experiments for BBC's micro:bit v2 (compatibility with v1 is not guaranteed).

## Metronome
Audio-visual simulation of a Maelzer metronome; using the buttons A, B to control the tempo.
**At least on Mozilla Firefox, [MakeCode](https://makecode.microbit.org/#)'s emulator doesn't seem to be stable enough to keep proper tempo.** The code runs properly on the MCU.
